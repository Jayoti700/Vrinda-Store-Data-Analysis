In this project, I have performed data cleaning, processing, analysis and dashboard creation of store data in Excel.

Insights from store data:<br>
1.Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%).<br>
2.Maharashtra, Karnataka and Utter Pradesh are the top 3.<br>
3.Adult age group (30-49 years) is max contributing (~50%).<br>
4.Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80%).<br>
